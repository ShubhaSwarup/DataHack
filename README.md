Predicting Vaccine Uptake: A Multilabel Classification Approach for XYZ and Seasonal Flu Vaccines


This project aims to predict individuals' likelihood of receiving both XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines using a dataset encompassing demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features. Employing machine learning techniques such as RandomForestClassifier within a MultiOutputClassifier framework, the model is trained to predict probabilities rather than binary outcomes. Evaluation is based on ROC AUC scores, ensuring robust performance assessment for each vaccine category independently. The results are formatted for submission, aligning with competition requirements for multilabel prediction tasks.
